     <p><b>Title</b>: Exploring human representations of facial affect.<br><b>Investigators</b>: Haijiang Yan, Adam Sanborn, Nick Chater, Christian Tsvetkov. </p>

            <p>Welcome and thank you for participating! This research study is on identifying humanâ€™s category representations for facial affect. You will be asked to rate a series of faces according to their arousal and valence. In each trial, you will see a face with specific emotion and a grid beneath it. You need to rate the feeling of the face by selecting a position on the rating grid. The experiment will take around 20 minutes to complete. Once finished, you will be eligible for a compensation of 3 pounds.</p>

            <p>We are conducting this research as part of my PhD research and this work is funded by a European Research Council grant (817492-SAMPLING).</p>

            <p>Your participation is completely voluntary. You can withdraw at any time, and for any reason, simply by closing your browser. If you withdraw, your incomplete data will be removed from the dataset completely.</p>

            <p>No identifiable data will be collected from you as part of this study. This means that once your responses have been submitted to the research team, it will not be possible to withdraw this data as your individual responses cannot be identified.</p>

            <p>Data will be securely stored on University of Warwick servers (on an access-restricted drive shared by investigators listed above) and will be processed only for the purpose of scientific analysis.  Access to the data will be restricted to the investigators listed above. Summaries may be presented at conferences and included in scientific publications. Data will be reviewed on completion of the research, in line with the University of Warwick data retention policy. After review, anonymised data will eventually be made openly accessible for future scientific analysis carried out by us or other researchers.</p>

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<p>In this experiment, you will be shown a face that expresses a certain feeling. You will be asked to assess the feeling on the "affect grid" below the face. A typical trial is illustrated below:</p>

        <img src="images/trial.png" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid #555;" height="530" width="440">

        <p>On the "affect grid", the center square (marked by bold boarder) represents a <strong style="color: red;">neutral, average, everyday feeling</strong>. It is neither positive nor negative. <br><br>The vertical dimension of the "affect grid" represents degree of arousal. Arousal has to do with how <strong style="color: red;">awake, alert, or energetic</strong> a person feels --- no matter whether the feeling is positive or negative; The bottom represents sleep, and the higher you go, the more awake a person feels. If you imagine a state we might call frantic excitement (remembering that it could be either positive or negative),then this feeling would define the top of the grid.<br><br>The right half of the grid represents <strong style="color: red;">pleasant</strong> feelings --- the farther to the right, the more pleasant. The left half represents <strong style="color: red;">unpleasant</strong> feelings --- the farther to the left, the more unpleasant.</p>

        <p>Some examples: </p>

        <img src="images/example.png" style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid #555;" height="250" width="300">

        <br><br>

        <p>In each trial when the face appears, you will click on the square within the "affect grid" you think best describes the face. Try to think about the feeling expressed by the face when making the decision. You will see 220 faces totally, taking 20 minutes approxmately.</p>

        <p>We will firstly have a very brief test to guarantee your understanding of the rules. You can proceed to the formal experiment after finishing the test correctly. </p>
