            <p><b>Title</b>: Exploring human representations of facial affect.<br><b>Investigators</b>: Haijiang Yan, Adam Sanborn, Nick Chater, Christian Tsvetkov. </p>

            <p>Welcome and thank you for participating! This research study is on identifying human’s category representations for facial affect. You will be asked to make a series of decisions about faces. You may see two faces with specific emotion on the screen and need to pick one of them (“left” or “right”) according to your response to the question asked above the image (e.g., “Who looks happier?” or “Who looks sadder?” or “Who looks more neutral?”). You may also see one face on the screen, and need to pick one of three options (“Happy”, “Sad” and “Neutral”) to describe the face and then adjust the slider to show your confidence on your choice. Once finished, you will be eligible for a compensation.</p>

            <p>We are conducting this research as part of my PhD research and this work is funded by a European Research Council grant (817492-SAMPLING).</p>

            <p>Your participation is completely voluntary. You can withdraw at any time, and for any reason, simply by closing your browser. If you withdraw, your incomplete data will be removed from the dataset completely.</p>

            <p>No identifiable data will be collected from you as part of this study. This means that once your responses have been submitted to the research team, it will not be possible to withdraw this data as your individual responses cannot be identified.</p>

            <p>Data will be securely stored on University of Warwick servers (on an access-restricted drive shared by investigators listed above) and will be processed only for the purpose of scientific analysis.  Access to the data will be restricted to the investigators listed above. Summaries may be presented at conferences and included in scientific publications. Data will be reviewed on completion of the research, in line with the University of Warwick data retention policy. After review, anonymised data will eventually be made openly accessible for future scientific analysis carried out by us or other researchers.</p>
