     <p><b>Title</b>: Exploring human representations of facial affect.<br><b>Investigators</b>: Haijiang Yan, Adam Sanborn, Nick Chater, Christian Tsvetkov. </p>

            <p>Welcome and thank you for participating! This research study is on identifying humanâ€™s category representations for facial affect. You will be asked to rate a series of faces according to their affect. In each trial, you will see a face with specific emotion and a question below. You need to rate the facial affect on the scale from 1-9 to answer the question. The experiment will take around 15 minutes to complete. Once finished, you will be eligible for a compensation of 2.5 GBP.</p>

            <p>We are conducting this research as part of my PhD research and this work is funded by a European Research Council grant (817492-SAMPLING).</p>

            <p>Your participation is completely voluntary. You can withdraw at any time, and for any reason, simply by closing your browser. If you withdraw, your incomplete data will be removed from the dataset completely.</p>

            <p>No identifiable data will be collected from you as part of this study. This means that once your responses have been submitted to the research team, it will not be possible to withdraw this data as your individual responses cannot be identified.</p>

            <p>Data will be securely stored on University of Warwick servers (on an access-restricted drive shared by investigators listed above) and will be processed only for the purpose of scientific analysis.  Access to the data will be restricted to the investigators listed above. Summaries may be presented at conferences and included in scientific publications. Data will be reviewed on completion of the research, in line with the University of Warwick data retention policy. After review, anonymised data will eventually be made openly accessible for future scientific analysis carried out by us or other researchers.</p>

<p>In this experiment, you will be shown a face that expresses a certain emotion. You will be asked to assess the face on a scale from 1 to 9 (for example, rate how happy is the face, 1='not happy', 9='very happy'). You will select the option between 1 to 9 on the scale that you think best describes the face, answering a different question in each block. There will be 3 blocks: happy, sad and neutral (the order is random).</p>

<p>You will rate 183 faces in total, taking around 15 minutes to complete.</p>
